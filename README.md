# Full-stack practice
This is a repository for my full-stack practice by looking at online tutorials and taking various online courses. 

The practice includes [MEAN stack](http://mean.io/#!/).

## Courses/tutorials taken
### Create a MEAN Stack Google Map App
Followed the tutorial and built a basic application with MEAN Stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node) with Google Maps.  
Application allows users to add themselves onto a Google Map map with identifying markers based on their form response. The application also demonstrates the use of HTML5 validated geolocation and the use of geospatial filtering through MongoDB.

See [this tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/making-mean-apps-with-google-maps-part-i) on scotch.io.
